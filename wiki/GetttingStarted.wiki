First, download a working copy into your computer. Create a folder where you want to keep the code, and run
{{{
svn checkout http://huji-rich.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ huji-rich-read-only
}}}
The next command will download all the dependencies, install them, and set the environment variables accordingly.
{{{
make set_environ_vars.sh && `cat set_environ_vars.sh`
}}}
Note that this may take a long while the first time you run this command. If the dependencies installed successfully, running this command again should take just a few moments. Next, navigate to the tests folder
{{{
cd ./tests
}}}
To run one of the problems, for example, sedov taylor explosion, you will have to run a make script
{{{
make production/newtonian/two_dimensional/sedov_taylor_messy_grid/test_passed.res
}}}
This will copy, compile, link and run the code in a temporary folder. In order to view a snapshot of the density, use
{{{
python ../visualisation/two_dimensional/python/hdf5_voronoi_plot.py production/newtonian/two_dimensional/sedov_taylor_messy_grid/final.h5 pressure
}}}
This script loads the data in a hdf5 file and displays a map of the hydrodynamic variable defined in the second argument.
